I will attempt to make a minewseaper AI.

With no knowledge about making either an AI, nor neural networks, or any other form of
machine learning algorithms. I will go trough multiple examples trying to piece together
the puzzle and hopefully in the end I will end up with a version I am happy with.

First of I wanna make a minesweaper board, and see if I can replicate the games mechanics.
I am going to be using python for this and I am think only a terminal based example for now.
The visual stuff will come later.

Key game mechanics:
- Grid has x * y cells.
- Every cell has a: state, bomb, not bomb, empty, a neighboring bomb state.
- For every neighboring bomb in an empty cell, a number will display the amount of bombs.
- The first cell you click on will never be a bomb.
- If a empty cell with no neighbors is clicked, all other neighboring cells, will open as well.
- Cells that are not open, have one of three states, flagged, active and '?'.
- inputs of the board size and the amount of bombs should be displayed at the beginning.


How to make the board:
- I am thinking of making up the board using multiple 2D arrays/lists, one list for the
  the active cells board where. This will represent every cell that has not been
  opened yet. This will have a value of: Active or Dead.
  The second List will contain all bombs. This list will only be used to set up the
  actual playing board, that will be the third list, containing all bombs, numbers
  and empty cells. --- The second list will only be used for calculating purposes. I bet
  there is a better way to go about this, if you think of anything. Let me know, for now
  I will stick with this ---

- Naming the lists:
    liveCells = [[]] //This will only tell whether the current cell has been opened.
    bombCells = [[]] //This will randomize the board with bombs.
    gameCells = [[]] //This will contain all numbers, and bombs.

- The game stops when either all bomb have been found so, or you press a liveCell
  with a bombCell behind it.



- bombCells:
    To spread out the amount of bombs on the board, I will randomize which cell
    should be given a bomb value first. Because there is more bombs then 50% of
    total numbers of cells, running the for loop normally will group up all the bombs
    in the top right corner, considering there is a 50% chance of a cell being a bomb
    or not. --- DISCLAIMER, there is also probably a better way to do this, but for now
    this is the only way I can think of to keep the total number of bombs be the same as
    the inputted bombAmount.

    I am not getting the method above to work, because the list cells have a chance of
    being overwritten, and replacing a bomb, this causes the total number of bombs to
    be incorrect. I have also been trying to look at other open source minesweaper games
    to see how they have done it, but I cant seem to understand it. At the point I am
    just trying to wrap my head around a new method to build the minefield.

    After tinkering around for a bit, I think I have found a way to make the gird
    store the value of 0 or 1. This is by first filling up the bombCells list with
    zeros, for then later to randomly fill the grid with 1s replacing the zeros.
    I am running into a couple of errors here and there, but I think I am no the
    right path.

    I have now managed to implement the random selection of bomb cells,
    the problem of overwriting already placed bombs is still there.
    atm I have an idea of how on how to fix this, however, it includes making a temporary
    list of placed bombs, and checking the main list towards this one, however, this seems
    like unnecessarily much work, and I am browsing the net for better ways. I think there
    is a way to generate a new number every time you call the random function.
    SOLUTION: I solved the problem by simply checking if the current random cell already
    had a value of 1, and put everything inside a while True loop, and only breaking it
    when the random value found a free cell. This means, it will try to find a free cell
    on and on, until it finds one.

    The game grid has now had its first test run, and worked as I expected. Next step on
    the agende will be to implement then number and and empty cells. As mentioned
    previously, this will be a sperate 2D list, fetching the bomb cells from the
    randBomb function.

    To calculate the neighbors I will run the list trough a nested for loop, looking for
    the value of 1 in every neighboring cell, this goes trough ever cell of the entire
    grid. I also will have to implement rules that does not allow to check neighbors
    outside the border of the grid. For the empty cells I will change their value to
    E, and the number of adjestent neighboring bomb I will just represent their cell with
    a number. This bumps into a problem where I have put the active bomb cells into
    the value of 1, and will have to change that to something like B, for bomb.
